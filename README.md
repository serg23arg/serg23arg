- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sergio
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested mainly in Python programming and data science. I'm 41 years old.
- ğŸŒ± I have a graduate in business administration, and I learn programmning by following courses and self-taught.
- ğŸ§¾ The majority of the descriptions, comments, messages, etc. that are found in my repositories are written in Spanish. In case you don't speak that language and
     need translated version/s for serious purposes (e.g.: to evaluate for a position), feel free to contact me, and I'll prepare an English version of it/them.
