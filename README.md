- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sergio. I'm 42 years old.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mainly interested in Python programming, SQL, Data Science and Machine Learning in all of it's variations.
- ðŸŒ± I have a degree in business administration, and I learn programming by following courses and self-taught. I'm particulary fond of the agricultural and livestock sector.
- ðŸ§¾ The majority of the descriptions, comments, messages, etc. that are found in my repositories are written in Spanish. If you don't speak that language and
     need translated version/s for serious purposes (e.g.: to evaluate for a position), feel free to contact me, and I'll prepare an English version of it/them for you.
